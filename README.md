# 👋 Hi, I'm Anindya Ratna Paramitha  

🎓 Computer Science student at **Universitas Brawijaya**  
💻 **Full-Stack Web Engineer (React-based) & Computer Vision Researcher**

I build **real-world software systems** — from web applications used by organizations to computer vision models trained on custom datasets.  
My focus is not just making things work, but making them **scalable, structured, and reliable in real environments**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- Develop **React & Next.js based web applications** for real clients and organizations  
- Design **frontend–backend architectures** that support clean data flow and usability  
- Conduct **computer vision research**, including dataset creation and model training  
- Turn vague problems into **working technical systems**

Currently:
> Working on a production **web platform** for a real side job  
> Conducting **computer vision research** in the BRONE Humanoid Research Team (UB)

## 🔧 Technical Capabilities

### Web Engineering (React-based)
- Built and maintained production web applications using **React and Next.js**  
- Designed responsive, component-based UI systems  
- Integrated frontend with backend services and databases  
- Optimized performance (loading speed, rendering, asset delivery)  
- Fixed live bugs and maintained deployed systems  

### Computer Vision & Machine Learning
- Built **custom image datasets** (collection, labeling, preprocessing)  
- Trained **image classification & object detection** models using **PyTorch**  
- Developed **visual-based affiliation detection** (UB vs non-UB)  
- Applied **data augmentation, preprocessing, and model evaluation**  
- Explored **facial recognition and identity-based extensions**

### Backend & Data
- PHP (Laravel), Java  
- MySQL / MariaDB  
- Python (NumPy, Pandas)

### DevOps & Tools
- Git & GitHub based workflow  
- Server setup, maintenance, and livestreaming infrastructure  
- VS Code, Anaconda, Figma

## 🧩 My Engineering Style

I like working at the intersection of:

> **logic × UI × real-world constraints**

That means:
- Clean architecture, not spaghetti code  
- Usable UI, not just working backend  
- Systems that survive real users, not just demos

## 🧠 Leadership & Execution

Alongside engineering, I also lead and execute systems involving people:

- Head of Events Division — **IT FEST 2025** (led 10-member team, 4 main sessions)  
- Managed **run-of-show, timing, and real-time problem solving**  
- Coordinated **cross-divisional teams** under live operational pressure  

This gives me strong experience in **system execution, not just design**.
