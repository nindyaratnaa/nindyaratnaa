# 👋 Hi, I'm Anindya Ratna Paramitha  

🎓 Computer Science student at **Universitas Brawijaya**  
💻 Focused on **Web Development, System Design, and Practical Software Engineering**

I build **real-world oriented applications** — not just for assignments, but for solving actual problems.  
My interest is not just making things *work*, but making them **clean, scalable, and usable**.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

- Build **web applications** with clean UI and structured logic  
- Design **system flows** (how data moves, how users interact, how logic is organized)  
- Turn vague ideas into **working software**

Right now, I’m working on:
> A **web-based project for a real side job**, where I handle both front-end implementation and backend logic support.

## 🔧 Core Tech Stack (what I really use)

**Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- React, Next.js  
- Tailwind / Bootstrap, Figma

**Backend & Data**
- PHP (Laravel), Java  
- MySQL / MariaDB  
- Python (NumPy, Pandas for data handling)

**Tools**
- Git & GitHub  
- VS Code, Anaconda

## 🧩 My Interests

- Web Development & Software Engineering  
- Data Processing & Problem Solving  
- Basic Network & Security Concepts  

I like working at the intersection of:
> **logic × UI × real-world needs**
